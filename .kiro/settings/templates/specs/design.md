# Design Document Template

---
**Purpose**: Provide sufficient detail to ensure implementation consistency across different implementers, preventing interpretation drift.

**Approach**:
- Include essential sections that directly inform implementation decisions
- Omit optional sections unless critical to preventing implementation errors
- Match detail level to feature complexity
- Use diagrams and tables over lengthy prose

**Warning**: Approaching 1000 lines indicates excessive feature complexity that may require design simplification or splitting into multiple specs.
---

> Sections may be reordered (e.g., surfacing Requirements Traceability earlier or moving Data Models nearer Architecture) when it improves clarity. Within each section, keep the flow **Summary → Scope → Decisions → Impacts/Risks** so reviewers can scan consistently.

## Overview 
2-3 paragraphs max
**Purpose**: This feature delivers [specific value] to [target users].
**Users**: [Target user groups] will utilize this for [specific workflows].
**Impact** (if applicable): Changes the current [system state] by [specific modifications].


### Goals
- Primary objective 1
- Primary objective 2  
- Success criteria

### Non-Goals
- Explicitly excluded functionality
- Future considerations outside current scope
- Integration points deferred

## Boundary Commitments

State the responsibility boundary of this spec in concrete terms. Treat this as the anchor for architecture, tasks, and later validation.

### This Spec Owns
- Capabilities and behaviors this spec is responsible for
- Data it owns or is authoritative for
- Interfaces or contracts it defines or stabilizes

### Out of Boundary
- Related concerns this spec explicitly does NOT own
- Work deferred to another spec, existing subsystem, or later phase
- Changes this spec must not absorb as "just one more thing"

### Allowed Dependencies
- Upstream systems/specs/components this design may depend on
- Shared infrastructure this design may use
- Dependency constraints that must not be violated

### Revalidation Triggers
List the kinds of changes that should force dependent specs or consumers to re-check integration.

- Contract shape changes
- Data ownership changes
- Dependency direction changes
- Startup/runtime prerequisite changes

## Architecture

> Reference detailed discovery notes in `research.md` only for background; keep design.md self-contained for reviewers by capturing all decisions and contracts here.
> Capture key decisions in text and let diagrams carry structural detail—avoid repeating the same information in prose.
> Supporting sections below should remain as light as possible unless they materially clarify the responsibility boundary, dependency rules, or integration seams.

### Existing Architecture Analysis (if applicable)
When modifying existing systems:
- Current architecture patterns and constraints
- Existing domain boundaries to be respected
- Integration points that must be maintained
- Technical debt addressed or worked around

### Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map
**RECOMMENDED**: Include Mermaid diagram showing the chosen architecture pattern and system boundaries (required for complex features, optional for simple additions)

**Architecture Integration**:
- Selected pattern: [name and brief rationale]
- Domain/feature boundaries: [how responsibilities are separated to avoid conflicts]
- Existing patterns preserved: [list key patterns]
- New components rationale: [why each is needed]
- Steering compliance: [principles maintained]

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice / Version | Role in Feature | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Frontend / CLI | | | |
| Backend / Services | | | |
| Data / Storage | | | |
| Messaging / Events | | | |
| Infrastructure / Runtime | | | |

> Keep rationale concise here and, when more depth is required (trade-offs, benchmarks), add a short summary plus pointer to the Supporting References section and `research.md` for raw investigation notes.

## File Structure Plan

Map the directory structure and file responsibilities for this feature. This section directly drives task `_Boundary:_` annotations and implementation Task Briefs. Use the appropriate level of detail:

- **Small features**: List individual files with responsibilities
- **Large features**: Describe directory-level structure + per-domain/module pattern, list only non-obvious files individually

### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── domain-a/              # Domain A responsibility
│   ├── controller.ts      # Endpoint handlers
│   ├── service.ts         # Business logic
│   └── types.ts           # Domain types
├── domain-b/              # Domain B (same pattern as domain-a)
└── shared/
    └── cross-cutting.ts   # Non-obvious: why this exists
```

> For repeated structures, describe the pattern once (e.g., "domain-b follows same pattern as domain-a"). List individual files only when their responsibility isn't obvious from the path.

### Modified Files
- `path/to/existing.ts` — What changes and why

> Each file should have one clear responsibility. Group files that change together. For repeated structures, describe the pattern once rather than listing every file.
> Avoid duplicating what Components and Interfaces already describes — focus on the physical file layout that Components maps to.

## System Flows

Provide only the diagrams needed to explain non-trivial flows. Use pure Mermaid syntax. Common patterns:
- Sequence (multi-party interactions)
- Process / state (branching logic or lifecycle)
- Data / event flow (pipelines, async messaging)

Skip this section entirely for simple CRUD changes.
> Describe flow-level decisions (e.g., gating conditions, retries) briefly after the diagram instead of restating each step.

## Requirements Traceability

Use this section for complex or compliance-sensitive features where requirements span multiple domains. Straightforward 1:1 mappings can rely on the Components summary table.

Map each requirement ID (e.g., `2.1`) to the design elements that realize it.

| Requirement | Summary | Components | Interfaces | Flows |
|-------------|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1.1 | | | | |
| 1.2 | | | | |

> Omit this section only when a single component satisfies a single requirement without cross-cutting concerns.

## Components and Interfaces

Provide a quick reference before diving into per-component details.

- Summaries can be a table or compact list. Example table:
  | Component | Domain/Layer | Intent | Req Coverage | Key Dependencies (P0/P1) | Contracts |
  |-----------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|
  | ExampleComponent | UI | Displays XYZ | 1, 2 | GameProvider (P0), MapPanel (P1) | Service, State |
- Only components introducing new boundaries (e.g., logic hooks, external integrations, persistence) require full detail blocks. Simple presentation components can rely on the summary row plus a short Implementation Note.

Group detailed blocks by domain or architectural layer. For each detailed component, list requirement IDs as `2.1, 2.3` (omit “Requirement”). When multiple UI components share the same contract, reference a base interface/props definition instead of duplicating code blocks.

### [Domain / Layer]

#### [Component Name]

| Field | Detail |

## Error Handling

### Error Strategy
Concrete error handling patterns and recovery mechanisms for each error type.

### Error Categories and Responses
**User Errors** (4xx): Invalid input → field-level validation; Unauthorized → auth guidance; Not found → navigation help
**System Errors** (5xx): Infrastructure failures → graceful degradation; Timeouts → circuit breakers; Exhaustion → rate limiting  
**Business Logic Errors** (422): Rule violations → condition explanations; State conflicts → transition guidance

**Process Flow Visualization** (when complex business logic exists):
Include Mermaid flowchart only for complex error scenarios with business workflows.

### Monitoring
Error tracking, logging, and health monitoring implementation.

## Testing Strategy

### Default sections (adapt names/sections to fit the domain)
- Unit Tests: 3–5 items from core functions/modules (e.g., auth methods, subscription logic)
- Integration Tests: 3–5 cross-component flows (e.g., webhook handling, notifications)
- E2E/UI Tests (if applicable): 3–5 critical user paths (e.g., forms, dashboards)
- Performance/Load (if applicable): 3–4 items (e.g., concurrency, high-volume ops)

## Optional Sections (include when relevant)

### Security Considerations
_Use this section for features handling auth, sensitive data, external integrations, or user permissions. Capture only decisions unique to this feature; defer baseline controls to steering docs._
- Threat modeling, security controls, compliance requirements
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Data protection and privacy considerations

### Performance & Scalability
_Use this section when performance targets, high load, or scaling concerns exist. Record only feature-specific targets or trade-offs and rely on steering documents for general practices._
- Target metrics and measurement strategies
- Scaling approaches (horizontal/vertical)
- Caching strategies and optimization techniques

### Migration Strategy
Include a Mermaid flowchart showing migration phases when schema/data movement is required.
- Phase breakdown, rollback triggers, validation checkpoints

## Supporting References (Optional)
- Create this section only when keeping the information in the main body would hurt readability (e.g., very long TypeScript definitions, vendor option matrices, exhaustive schema tables). Keep decision-making context in the main sections so the design stays self-contained.
- Link to the supporting references from the main text instead of inlining large snippets.
- Background research notes and comparisons continue to live in `research.md`, but their conclusions must be summarized in the main design.
